# \# Industrial Vision Inspection System

# 

# \## Problem

# Manufacturing production lines require continuous quality inspection. Manual inspection is slow, inconsistent, and expensive, especially for small factories without dedicated automation systems.

# 

# \## Solution

# This project demonstrates a deployable computer vision inspection pipeline capable of detecting products using a standard camera and classifying them in real time.

# 

# The system simulates a production-line inspection setup and outputs a PASS/FAIL decision for each item.

# 

# \## Features

# \- Real-time webcam inspection

# \- Object detection pipeline using YOLOv8

# \- Continuous processing loop

# \- Simple decision logic for quality control

# \- Modular and extensible architecture for industrial integration

# 

# \## How to Run

# 1\. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Run the inspection:
===

python app/camera\_inspection.py



3\. Press `Q` to exit.



\## Notes

This is a clean-room demonstration project built using public models and synthetic testing scenarios to illustrate a real-world industrial inspection architecture.
