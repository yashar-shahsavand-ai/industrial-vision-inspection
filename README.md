# Industrial Vision Inspection System

## Problem
Manufacturing production lines require continuous quality inspection. Manual inspection is slow, inconsistent, and expensive, especially for small factories without dedicated automation systems.

## Solution
This project demonstrates a deployable computer vision inspection pipeline capable of detecting products using a standard camera and classifying them in real time.

The system simulates a production-line inspection setup and outputs a PASS/FAIL decision for each item.

## Features
- Real-time webcam inspection
- Object detection pipeline using YOLOv8
- Continuous processing loop
- Simple decision logic for quality control
- Modular and extensible architecture for industrial integration

## How to Run
